## Setup Instructions 🚀

### Step 1: Clone the Project  

Open a terminal (PowerShell, CMD or Git Bash) and enter the following command to clone the repository:
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/IshakAtes/baby-tools-shop.git
```



### Step 2: Create a Python virtual environment
Our application runs locally on our computer, but it is possible that someone else who has a different python or
django version does not run. It is possible that our project does not run so well with an old python version. 
However, to ensure that the application runs smoothly on the server, we pack all dependent applications (python, django, docker etc)
with the correct version into the virtual environment. These specified applications are then installed on the server with the dependent version, 
so that it also runs on the server. Similar to firebase package.json and package-lock.json

Create a virtual environment:
``` bash
python -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:
``` bash
"venv/Scripts/activate"
```
> [!Note]
> Note: Use Command Prompt or VS Code's terminal, not PowerShell.



### Step 3: Install Python Dependencies
Check installed packages:
``` bash
pip freeze
```

Create a requirements file to store project dependencies:
``` bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

the cloned application requires Django 4.0.2 according to the readme, therefore adjust the version in requirement.txt

Install the packages with pip install -r requirements.txt.
``` bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> [!Note]
> if you have an old pip version, you can update it with this command:
> ``` bash
> pip install --upgrade pip
> ```


> [!Note] According to the error message, pillow is required for the cloned application. Therefore, we should first check which version of pillow is > compatible with our Python and Django version and then add it to 'requirements.txt' and run 'pip install -r requirements.txt' again.
``` bash
Django==4.0.2
Pillow==9.0.0
```

install requirements again
``` bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Use pip freeze to check whether everything has been installed correctly.
``` bash
pip freeze
```


### Step 4 Test project locally
navigate to babyshop_app and execute the migrate command:
``` bash
(venv) C:\Users\user-directory\Desktop\DevSecOps\baby-tools-shop\babyshop_app>
```

1. Perform database migrations:
``` bash
python manage.py migrate
```

2. Start the local server:
``` bash
python manage.py runserver
```

3. Open your browser and go to:
``` bash
http://127.0.0.1:8000
```
> [!Note]
> Note: Check that the page is displayed correctly.



### Step 5: Create Dockerfile

``` bash
# 1 Start with a base image
FROM python:3.9-slim

# 2 Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# 3. copy requirements.txt into the Docker image
COPY requirements.txt /app/

# 4 Install all dependencies
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

# 5 Copy the project files into the container
COPY ./babyshop_app /app

# 6. expose the port on which the application is running
EXPOSE 8025

# 7. start the application
CMD ["python", "manage.py", "runserver", "0.0.0.0:8025"]
```
> [!Note]
> The file should be located as a 'Dockerfile' in the main project folder.



### Step 6: Docker Setup 🐳

1. Open Docker Desktop and let it run in the background. Then return to your vs-code or terminal

2. Build the Docker image:
``` bash
docker build -t baby-tools-shop .
```

3. Launch the container:
``` bash
docker run -p 8025:8025 baby-tools-shop
```


### Step 7: Check the website
Open your browser and go to:
``` bash
http://localhost:8025
```
